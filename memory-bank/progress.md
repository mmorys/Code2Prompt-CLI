# Progress

## What Works

- Core memory bank structure is established
- Project brief and context documentation completed
- System patterns and technical context documented
- Active context tracking initialized

## What's Left to Build

- Review and refine all memory bank documentation
- Explore actual source code to validate assumptions
- Update documentation based on real implementation details
- Establish testing and development workflows

## Current Status

✅ Memory bank initialization in progress
✅ Core documentation files created
🕐 Documentation review and refinement pending
🕐 Source code exploration pending

## Known Issues

- Assumptions made about CLI framework and implementation details
- Technical context based on patterns rather than actual source code
- Dependencies and build system inferred from project structure

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Initial Setup**: Memory bank structure established following Cline guidelines
2. **Documentation Priority**: Core context files created first to establish understanding
3. **Next Phase**: Source code exploration to validate documentation accuracy

## Milestones

- [x] Initialize memory bank structure
- [ ] Review and validate documentation against source code
- [ ] Establish development environment and workflows
- [ ] Begin feature development or enhancement work
