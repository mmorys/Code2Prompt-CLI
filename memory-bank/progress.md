# Progress Tracking

## What Works Currently
- ✅ Full CLI functionality with Click argument parsing
- ✅ pyproject.toml configuration with all required dependencies
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation structure is established and accurate
- ✅ Entry point properly configured and working
- ✅ Basic testing framework with passing tests
- ✅ Successful integration with code2prompt-rs library
- ✅ End-to-end prompt generation workflow
- ✅ Clipboard integration working correctly
- ✅ File filtering with include/exclude patterns
- ✅ All CLI options properly implemented

## What's Been Accomplished
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation aligned with actual project state
- ✅ Project brief updated to reflect early development stage
- ✅ Product context documented with real requirements
- ✅ Technical context updated with actual dependencies
- ✅ System patterns documented with planned architecture
- ✅ Active context established with clear next steps
- ✅ Full CLI implementation with all planned options
- ✅ Basic testing framework established

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Complete CLI functionality implemented
- ✅ Full argument parsing and command structure
- ✅ Successful integration with code2prompt-rs library
- ✅ File filtering and context assembly working with real implementation
- ✅ Output generation and clipboard integration
- ✅ Comprehensive help system

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Enhance Testing**: Add comprehensive integration tests with real code2prompt-rs
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large codebases
3. **Advanced Features**: Implement configuration files and advanced templates
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed usage guides and examples

## Planned Features (In Progress)
- [x] Flexible file filtering (glob patterns, .gitignore integration) - CLI structure complete
- [x] Clipboard integration for automatic copying - CLI structure complete
- [x] Custom prompt templates - CLI structure complete
- [x] Git integration (diffs, commit history) - CLI structure complete
- [x] Multiple output formats - CLI structure complete
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [x] Comprehensive testing suite - Basic framework established

## Known Issues
- ️ Integration testing with real code2prompt-rs needs expansion
- ⚠️ Performance optimization for very large codebases
- ✅ All CLI structure and argument handling is working
- ✅ Real code2prompt-rs integration is functional

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Realization**: Project is much earlier in development than Memory Bank initially assumed
- **Adjustment**: Focus shifted from enhancement to core implementation
- **Clarification**: Understanding that this is a Python wrapper for code2prompt-rs
- **Completion**: Core CLI structure is now fully implemented
- **Next Phase**: Focus on actual code2prompt-rs integration

## Milestones
- [x] **Phase 1 Complete**: Basic CLI with argument parsing ✅
- [x] **Phase 2 Complete**: code2prompt-rs integration ✅
- [x] **Phase 3 Complete**: File filtering and context assembly ✅
- [x] **Phase 4 Complete**: Prompt generation and output handling ✅
- [ ] **Phase 5 Complete**: Advanced features implementation ⏳
