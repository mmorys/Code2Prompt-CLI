# Progress Tracking

## What Works Currently
- ✅ Full CLI functionality with Click argument parsing
- ✅ pyproject.toml configuration with all required dependencies
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation structure is established and accurate
- ✅ Entry point properly configured and working
- ✅ Basic testing framework with passing tests

## What's Been Accomplished
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation aligned with actual project state
- ✅ Project brief updated to reflect early development stage
- ✅ Product context documented with real requirements
- ✅ Technical context updated with actual dependencies
- ✅ System patterns documented with planned architecture
- ✅ Active context established with clear next steps
- ✅ Full CLI implementation with all planned options
- ✅ Basic testing framework established

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Complete CLI functionality implemented
- ✅ Full argument parsing and command structure
- ⚠️ Mock integration with code2prompt-rs library (needs real integration)
- ✅ File filtering and context assembly (mock implementation)
- ✅ Output generation and clipboard integration
- ✅ Comprehensive help system

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Integrate code2prompt-rs**: Connect to actual core functionality
2. **Replace Mock Implementation**: Use real code2prompt-rs for context generation
3. **Enhance Testing**: Add more comprehensive test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Update README with usage examples

## Planned Features (In Progress)
- [x] Flexible file filtering (glob patterns, .gitignore integration) - CLI structure complete
- [x] Clipboard integration for automatic copying - CLI structure complete
- [x] Custom prompt templates - CLI structure complete
- [x] Git integration (diffs, commit history) - CLI structure complete
- [x] Multiple output formats - CLI structure complete
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [x] Comprehensive testing suite - Basic framework established

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ code2prompt-rs integration is currently mocked
- ⚠️ No actual codebase processing functionality (mock implementation only)
- ✅ All CLI structure and argument handling is working

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Realization**: Project is much earlier in development than Memory Bank initially assumed
- **Adjustment**: Focus shifted from enhancement to core implementation
- **Clarification**: Understanding that this is a Python wrapper for code2prompt-rs
- **Completion**: Core CLI structure is now fully implemented
- **Next Phase**: Focus on actual code2prompt-rs integration

## Milestones
- [x] **Phase 1 Complete**: Basic CLI with argument parsing ✅
- [ ] **Phase 2 Complete**: code2prompt-rs integration ⏳
- [ ] **Phase 3 Complete**: File filtering and context assembly ⏳
- [ ] **Phase 4 Complete**: Prompt generation and output handling ⏳
- [ ] **Phase 5 Complete**: Advanced features implementation ⏳
